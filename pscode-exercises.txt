// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

create double variable x, y
Calculate x + y = z
print out to screen z

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

create double variable x
use the modulus operator to divide by 2 and find the remainder 
using an if statement if x % 2 == 0 print number is Even
else number is odd with a return value of 1

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) create an array for numbers 1-5
b) calculate the sum of numbers 1-5 divided by 5
c) create two double variables with the min and max methods under System.Linq to store the minimum and maximum values from the array
d) print out "The average of numbers 1-5" + average, and print out "Minimum Number = " [variable holding min value of array]
"Maximum number = " [variable holding max value of array]
